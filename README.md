Learning Python

Hello World!!

I am Robin. I like coding. I love python. Can't wait to be a game programmer and help build amazing games in the future.
Hope GitHub helps me to do so. Just like Robin being a sad bird, ironically my life has become sad too. Waiting eagerly for that day, all my sorrows sweeps away like sawdust. Glory to god for the strength and knowledge. Truely hes a provider. he creates he destroys. if these problems were created by him, they will destroyed by him too. I'm just waiting.
